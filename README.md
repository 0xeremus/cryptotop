##### Disclaimer

Don't use this. Is literally only here for me to implement things for in a 'fuck around an find out kind of way' while I learn rust, without just having random implementations stack up in random folders on my computer. Every single piece of functionality will be implemented better in cyberchef or something else, so go use that.
